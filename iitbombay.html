<div>
<p>IIT Bombay, established in 1958, was the second Indian Institute of Technology to be founded. Its establishment was supported by UNESCO, with funding provided by the Soviet Union. The proposed site for the institute, allocated by the government of Bombay State, was Powai in what is now Mumbai, then known as Bombay. The institute's first batch, composed of 100 male students, commenced their studies in a temporary facility in Worli during their first year due to the construction of the campus in Powai. They graduated in 1962. On 9 July 2018, Prakash Javadekar, the Union Minister of Human Resources Development, announced that IIT Bombay would be granted the status of Institution of Eminence. The decision came into effect on 11 October 2018.</p> </div>

IIT Bombay is a small township in itself. Rich in natural flora and fauna to begin with, the campus' green cover has been maintained and even increased over the years. An island of green in the otherwise concrete jungle that is Mumbai, the campus at Powai nestles among hills and is flanked by the Powai and Vihar lakes.  It is special both in terms of its physical beauty and location — a place where you can be away from the busy world, yet still be a part of it. Education and research are the twin pillars of this institute and the ambience is one in which new ideas and creativity can flourish.
The campus is connected to the city proper — an hour's distance —  by buses and local trains. However, most facilities are available on campus itself, including banks, a shopping centre, two excellent schools for children, and a well-equipped hospital. All students and most faculty live on campus, in student hostels and IIT staff quarters. The peaceful atmosphere of the campus belies the wide range of activities that complement academic life.
The 545-acre IIT Bombay campus is located between Powai lake and Vihar lake, roughly 15 kilometres away from the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport.The institute has a total of 18 hostels, of which three hostels (Hostels 10, 11, and 15) and a wing of the newly constructed hostel (Hostel 16) are for female students.

Due to its proximity to the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, the campus has enjoyed significant green cover. The proximity of the campus to the national park has also led to occasional sightings of leopards and mugger crocodiles. On rare occasions, they have strayed into the campus
The institute has two swimming pools; football, hockey, and cricket grounds; as well as tennis, basketball, squash, and volleyball courts. It also has a Students' Activity Center (SAC) for various cultural and extracurricular activities.

<div>
<p>A student from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay has shared his campus experience on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), calling it a "tech nerd's paradise." Vijendra Kumar Vaishya, who is now a month into his master's programme in computer science, posted a thread detailing his experiences living and studying at IIT Bombay. His thread quickly went viral, capturing widespread attention.
In his post, Mr Vijendra praised the vibrant atmosphere of the Computer Science department, noting that it is always buzzing with students working on laptops and enjoying coffee. "The CSE department is like a tech nerd's paradise. You'll find people with their laptops and endless coffee, and plenty of chill spots to hang out," he wrote.
He also commended the supportive lab staff and approachable seniors. "The lab crew is fantastic - any question, just ask. Seniors are always around to help, and they're not even grumpy about it!" Vijendra noted.
The student described the hostel rooms as "cozy" but admitted he often studies late into the night at the CSE department, which is open around the clock. "Hostel rooms are cozy, but the campus is basically one giant study hall. I crash in the CSE department all night because it's always open," he shared.
</p> </div>
          
              <div><p> On campus life, he appreciated the absence of hostel restrictions. "There's no hostel curfew. Yes, you read that right-girls' hostels don't lock up either!" he posted</p></div>

                <div> <p>He also mentioned that his classes are scheduled just two days a week, providing him with ample time for other activities.Food has been convenient, with 24/7 ordering options available within the hostel. However, he added a humorous note: "You'll be too busy to date. Your new love affair will be labs, assignments, and events."

Mr Vijendra highlighted the campus amenities, including a gym, hospital, tennis courts, and a swimming pool. "Basically, if you're not studying, you're working out or swimming". </p></div>

    <strong>Rewiew 1:</strong>Hey. I am a Btech student who just joined IIT Bombay this July.
This is a wonderful place to be. The only thing that I feel can describe my experience till now is that the efforts you put in JEE are worth it if you get here.
There are so many things going around it is sometimes difficult to decide where to go.
You have so many clubs that I can guarantee you,you will find something that interests you and also that you will find people with similar interests.
Believe me, I am living by myself for the first time and yet I don't wanna go home coz there is so much I would be missing out on.
As for acads, well there are mostly amazing professors although you may find some very pathetic ones too.
I can say that there is always help at iitb for those who want it.
So basically the day starts off with going to lectures then going to events,talking to people, hanging out with wingmates,exploring the institute.
A major thing that I forgot about, MOOD INDIGO…..if you don't know about it just Google it and I assure you you will be amazed.
Another perk of being at iitb is that celebrities come here almost every week for a lot of events.Believe me it's been just 3 months here and Bret Lee, Narendra Modi,Yami Gautam,Ankit Kumar,singers of huma,bolna,Laila ,Sadguru Mohit Chauhan have already visited the institute.
  </div>
   <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-4 bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 text-yellow-800 rounded-lg">
    <strong>Rewiew 2:</strong>There is no exact answer to this question. Some students say that life is great here and some may tell that life is hell here. Life at IIT Bombay is highly dependent on who you are and what you want. I will explain to you why.
HOSTELS AND MESS
Students who have come far from home for the first time, literally cry after seeing the condition of hostels and food. From the last 3–4 years the newcomers are allotted Hostels 15 and 16 which are nice and adjustable for a newcomer, but senior hostels from Hostel 2–9(given to undergraduate students from second year onwards) are too congested. Currently, my hostel room has size of around 9ft*7ft. Food is not as good as compared to home but is edible (except some days). Compared to general hostels or mess, Food Quality is good at IIT Bombay (trust me, it’s my 9th year in hostels). Hostel 10 -11 (girls hostel) is too good compared to hostel standards. Hostels 12–14 are for MTech and PhD students. These hostels are also good enough.
ACADEMICS and ATTENDANCE
Just like most of the other colleges, it also follows the rule of 80% attendance. Failed to do so results in a DX grade which means that you have to repeat the course. Grading policy used here is relative grading, which means that a particular % of class would get a particular grade and this thing depends on the professor. It seems that relative grading would be easy and would help in getting good grades, but here you are wrong. Relative grading makes the competition too worse. This is the place where many students think that if they would have chose some other IIT, they wouldn’t have felt this much academic pressure and could get a nice cpi with lower efforts. More than 10% of students fail at least in one subject each year.
SPORTS
IIT Bombay provides an excellent opportunity to excel in sports. It has got excellent sports facilities for cricket, football, athletics, hockey, squash, table tennis, lawn tennis, basketball, volleyball, badminton, weightlifting, swimming etc. In the beginning of first year some students are selected for each sport and they are trained well in that sport under the program NSO. Leaving it, beginner camps are organized from time to time for enthusiastic students who want to learn the fundamental skills required for the game. Advanced summer camps are also launched in the summer holidays to provide excellence in that particular sport.
Nearly all hostels have a basketball court, badminton court, table tennis, foosball, billiards, football ground, gym facilities etc. Due to these facilities, students are highly enthusiastic about sports here and this time IIT Bombay was the winner of INTER IIT SPORTS MEET 2017.
CULTURALS
IIT Bombay is no way behind in culturals. Be it music, dance, photography, fashion, dramatics, movie-making, design, speaking arts, etc. , IIT Bombay has got clubs for each of these which are managed by students.
Students here take part in many national and international competitions also. Silverscreen, design, and the debating club has won prizes at national as well as international level also.
At last but not the least, this time IIT Bombay stood second in the INTER IIT CULTURALS MEET 2017.
TECHNICAL
There are many clubs which are doing great work in the field of technology.
AUV-IITB(autonomous underwater vehicle)
INNOVATION CELL
SSP(student satellite program)
IIT B RACING
etc.
People who love to do technical stuff join these teams and these are the teams which win many international awards too. If you want, you can check on google.
EXPOSURE and MANAGEMENT
At IIT Bombay you get that level of exposure which you haven’t even thought of.
Similar is the case of management. In general students’ haven’t done much courses of management here, but the way in which they manage events like
MOOD INDIGO (Asia’s largest cultural fest)
TECHFEST (Asia’s largest technical fest)
ABHYUDAY (Asia’s largest social fest)
E-SUMMIT(Asia’s largest entrepreneurship fest)
is truly appreciable.
While working in these fests, you develop many types of soft skills.
You get to interact with International famous personalities, visit places like embassies, attend seminars which are not open for the general public and what not.
Now you would ask me that since IIT Bombay provides such excellent facilities, students should only love it, why do they hate?

    <strong>Rewiew 3:</strong>
It came as quite a shock to me that, yes, you still have to study after getting into IITB XD.
Life at IIT Bombay was good in the beginning, just a bunch of orientations you need to attend and there was no homework, of course. Our first lecture was of CS 101. But that was easy, as I had already done some coding in school.
Gradually the weight increased.
We were told we would have graded physics lab every week, graded mechanical workshops, and compulsory CS labs.
Then we had our first quiz. Calculus. I managed to score well, but there were people around me scoring very low. Midsems weren’t a pleasant experience either.
Life in IITB is how you want it to be. Right now (first year), especially. You could spend all of your time studying for AA grade, or bunk classes to sleep, and chill the entire rest of the day.

    <strong>Rewiew 4:</strong>
A few days ago I attended IIT Bombay E-Summit 2019 as a guest speaker.
I was simply blown away by the scale and size of the event. Honestly, for a moment I thought I was in some Silicon Valley conference. Anywhere you look, you would see banners and sponsorship hoardings of every major startup. The speaker lineup was amazingly diverse and impressive.

    <strong>Rewiew 5:</strong>
It’s hectic. And fun.
There’s always stuff to do.
There are several categories of people here:
The Studious type (maggu)
These would be the ones who care about their studies. They study with sincerity and forego most events and clubs. I don’t personally know anyone of this type, but I believe they’re common, especially in first year (they’re working for a branch change).
The Academic type
These are the ones who are serious about studies. But not to the point of the maggus. They don’t work so much for exams. Instead they participate in technical clubs and competitions. They try to get hands-on experience at everything.
There are several clubs available for such people. The Web and Coding Club, Aeromodelling Club etc. There’s also teams working to create new machines here, like the AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle), Student Satellite team etc.
The Cult Enthusiastic
They came to IIT Bombay to make their future secure. But as soon as they arrive, it’s clear that Engineering may be their wife, but they have a girlfriend as well (sorry for bad analogy :P)
There is a surprisingly large number of such people here. They’re not completely against studying Engineering, but they prefer to spend their spare time somewhere else.
They make full use of the huge number of cultural groups and competitions.
For example, The Dance Club, Debating Club etc.
Mood Indigo, the largest Cultural festival in Asia is held at IIT Bombay!
Sporting Ones
The guys who like to play and stay active.
There are several clubs for them as well. IITB boasts a lot of facilities for sports, including awesome badminton courts, swimming pool, basketball courts and so on…
None of the Above
Not everyone comes in one of the above categories.
There are many who play a lot, participate in cult and still find time for extracurricular studies. There are many who find a good mix for themselves.
Be warned: There are also many who do none of the above activities. There are people who fall prey to the high internet speeds and spacious rooms(only in first year :P) and become pretty anti-social. Watching movies or TV Series most of the time, or gaming alone.

    <strong>Rewiew 6:</strong> 
I won't iterate the same things said previously. Speaking very briefly, it is exactly the opposite of what people think will be, in an institution filled with the country's best minds (nerds as they call us).
Speaking from a UG fresher point of view, life changes totally after the gruelling two/three years. The drastic change is that we can now do things we like, we can prioritize stuff on our own. People with tech interests can really work on their own projects right from the start, while people with sporting and cultural interests also have great mentoring and platforms to perform and showcase their talents. It's not always about academics like it used to be.
