<p>NNIT Rourkela began life as Regional Engineering College (REC), Rourkela, inaugurated on Independence Day, 1961, emphasizing India’s drive for technical self-sufficiency. The institution was granted full autonomy and rechristened as NIT Rourkela in 2002, gaining the prestigious status of Institute of National Importance by the NIT Act. The school has expanded from humble beginnings—one building housing everything—to a 700-acre campus supporting over 7,700 students, 390+ faculty, and a robust research culture. Recognized as a premier institute for science, technology, and research, NITR continues to punch above its weight in national and international rankings.</p> </div>

NIT Rourkela’s campus is a self-contained universe—a sprawling 700-acre city on its own. Located on the eastern fringe of Rourkela, it houses over 7,700 students, 390+ faculty, administrative staff, and their families, fostering a unique academic and social community.
Infrastructure is a major asset: the campus includes well-designed academic blocks, fully networked classrooms, modern laboratories, and state-of-the-art research centers. The central library, with over 60,000 volumes and 1,400 periodicals, doubles as a digital repository—containing every dissertation and thesis produced. This digital openness empowers both current students and global researchers.
Hostel life is central, with nine halls of residence (seven for boys, two for girls), supporting over 3,000 boarders. Each hostel has badminton and volleyball courts, with further access to a sprawling sports complex offering cricket, football, basketball, tennis, swimming, and even a dedicated hockey stadium. Fitness enthusiasts frequent the gym; clubs and activity groups cater to every interest—technical, cultural, social, and entrepreneurial.
Dining options are abundant, ranging from hostel messes serving North and South Indian meals to on-campus cafés and eateries. Convenience stores, health and recreation centers, a guest house, banks, ATMs, post office, and Wi-Fi connectivity all add to the campus’s self-sufficient feel.
The academic calendar is balanced by a rich festive tradition: “Innovision” (the technical fest) and “Cosmopolitan Fest” (the cultural celebration) draw visitors nationally, offering avenues for talent showcase, collaboration, and celebration. Classroom schedules, generally between 8–11 a.m. and 1:15–4:15 p.m., leave afternoons and evenings for extracurricular pursuits. The flexible timetable, ample clubs, and vibrant peer group mean that academic challenges are offset by opportunities for growth in arts, sports, social work, and innovation.
A plural and welcoming ethos is central to campus life at NITR. Students from every Indian region and abroad bring together a cosmopolitan mix. The pace is relentless, but the support systems—formal and informal—are strong, ensuring students balance academics with personal development. The emphasis is not just on acquiring knowledge, but also on learning time management, resilience, and teamwork, turning out graduates who are skilled and adaptable.

    <strong>Review 1:</strong>Placements: All I want to say about placements is that mechanical students tend to get selected more into non-core, management, and other sectors than into core mechanical roles. So, yes, the placements look good on paper, but you need to realize there aren't many jobs available, and even if there are, they don't pay well.

Infrastructure: The hostels are pretty decent. The first-year boys' hostel is basic, but after that, the second-year Shivalik hostel is basically a hotel. The third and fourth-year single rooms are excellent. I think you won't be disappointed with them. They are better than most government colleges, though they have some issues too.

Faculty: The college offers a basic engineering education. It's the same as every other college, with nothing new an old curriculum that's recycled repeatedly. The teachers try to teach, but their assistants (TAs) often outperform them in teaching quality. It's pretty standard. Like every other college, there's nothing particularly innovative. </div>

    <strong>Review 2:</strong>
Placements: Nearly 97% of B.Tech students from Chemical Engineering got placed. In 2024, due to recession, the highest package was 25 LPA, with an average of 11.3 LPA, and there is no information about the lowest package. Companies like Reliance, MRPL, and HP participate, but specific details about internships are not available. Usually, junior-level engineers are offered positions within a short period and quickly promoted.

Infrastructure: Our entire campus is Wi-Fi enabled. Classrooms are well-equipped, and the library is the best spot on campus, housing nearly a lakh books. The hostels are clean, tidy, and well-maintained. The quality of the mess is unmatched. Basic medical checkups and medicines are available free of charge on campus. Most major sports are prioritized, and the college has won many trophies in inter-NIT tournaments.

Faculty: Most faculty members are well-qualified, with many holding advanced degrees and industry experience. Teaching quality can vary between departments, but core subjects are usually taught effectively using both theoretical and practical approaches. The curriculum is fairly updated and includes emerging topics in technology and research. However, industry-readiness often depends on how much extra effort students put in through internships, certification, and projects. Semester exams are moderately challenging and are more theory-focused. With consistent study and proper attendance, passing is quite achievable. Most students who attend regularly and study sincerely manage to pass without issues.

Other: I chose this course due to my strong interest and its broad career scope. NITK's reputation and placements were key factors. The curriculum is solid, with experienced faculty, good labs, and exposure to industry via workshops. Improvements could include more hands-on projects and flexible electives. NITK hosts vibrant fests like Incident and Engineer, with national participation. The diverse crowd, beachside campus, strong connectivity to Bangalore, scholarships, and active extracurricular make campus life well-rounded and enriching. </div></div>

    <strong>Review 3:</strong>
Placements: In my college, approximately 95% of students get placed, with the highest package being 54 LPA and the lowest 11 LPA. Some subjects in my course are very good. About 50% of the students in my course receive internships.

Infrastructure: Facilities provided to us are very good. Wi-Fi facility quality is also excellent. Classrooms are well-maintained and have Wi-Fi access. Regarding hostels, the food available is average. Medical facilities, sports, and games are also well-maintained.

Faculty: Teachers are very good, qualified, helpful, and knowledgeable. The semester exams are not too difficult but slightly above average, with a pass percentage of about 97-99%. The course curriculum is relevant and also prepares students for the industry.

Other: I choose this course because I love working on computers. The fests are very good.

    <strong>Review 4:</strong>
Placements: NIT Surathkal was located in Karnataka. It was one of the top 3 NITs in India. The placements at this college were jaw-dropping. Around 80–85% of students got placed in our course. The highest salary package at our college was 45 LPA, the average salary package was 24 LPA, and the lowest salary package was 16 LPA. Companies like Aditya Birla, Tata, and PhonePe recruited students from our course. Every student got an internship in the 2nd or 3rd year through hard work.

Infrastructure: Facilities available in our hostel included Wi-Fi, drinking water, lights, fans, and beds. Fully air-conditioned classrooms were available in our college. A central library was also available on our campus, and books could be issued by students. The quality of food in the mess was average. There were three canteens on our campus, and the fast food was good. We had a small ground to play different sports like volleyball, football, and cricket.

Faculty: Professors were well-qualified, helpful, and knowledgeable. All of them were Ph.D. holders. The courses were relevant to industry needs. However, students also needed to prepare themselves. Each semester had two exams. They were midterm and end-term. A minimum of 35% was required to pass the course.
