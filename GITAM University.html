IIT Madras is a residential institute that occupies a 2.5 km² (617 acre) campus that was formerly part of the adjoining Guindy National Park. The main entrance of IIT Madras is on Sardar Patel Road, flanked by the residential districts of Adyar and Velachery. The campus is close to the Raj Bhavan, the official seat of the Governor of Tamil Nadu.
The campus is located 10 km from the Chennai Airport, 12 km from the Chennai Central Railway station, and is well connected by city buses. Kasturba Nagar is the nearest station on the Chennai MRTS line.
Two parallel roads, Bonn Avenue and Delhi Avenue, cut through the faculty residential area, before they meet at the Gajendra Circle, near the Administrative Block. Buses regularly ply between the Main Gate, Gajendra Circle, the Academic Zone, and the Hostel Zone.
Much of the campus is a protected forest, carved out of the Guindy National Park, home to many animals that are not commonly seen in a busy city like Chennai. The campus has the pride of having one of the most elegant antelopes in the world - the Blackbuck. The campus is also home to large numbers of chital (spotted deer), bonnet macaque, monkeys and other rare wildlife. There is a lot of other smaller and exquisite life forms that play a major role in the biodiversity of the campus. The IIT campus has about 300 species of trees and plants with quite a large number of native wild species, which are unique to the tropical, dry evergreen vegetation. IIT Madras campus is a haven for bird watchers in the city. There are about 100 species of birds seen at different times of the year. There are quite a number of resident species as well as few migrants like Forest Wagtail, Pied Crested Cuckoo, Golden Oriole etc. which are migratory.
A natural lake, deepened in 1988 and 2003, drains most of its rainwater.

Further into the campus towards the end, you will find the hostel zone with various facilities for students. </p> </div>
